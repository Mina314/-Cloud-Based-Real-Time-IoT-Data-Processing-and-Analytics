# IoT smoke Dector Simulator
 I built a smoke data message simulator in the cloud to collect data of smoke, humidity, temperature, and carbon monoxide.

 This project used spark Kafka IoT big data streaming to process IoT simulated smoke data messages.

 Result: Acquired the smoke values, and filtered the data to find the values which caused the alert
